# Indoor Air Quality Modeling 🚩

This repository contains two detailed Jupyter Notebooks that simulate and analyze indoor air quality under various conditions. The models are built to understand the dynamics of pollutant emissions, their interaction with environmental variables, and their eventual concentrations in different mediums such as air and water.

## 🗂️ Notebooks

1. **Dynamic Modeling of NOx and SOx Concentrations in Restaurants** 🍴
   - Simulates the concentration profiles of NOx and SOx in a restaurant under constant and varying emission rates.
   - Models the impact of customer activity, ventilation, and decay mechanisms on indoor air quality.

2. **Formaldehyde Concentration in a Commercial Establishment** 🏢
   - Analyzes the impact of temperature on formaldehyde emissions from carpets in a commercial space.
   - Uses Henry's Law to compute the formaldehyde concentration in a glass of water exposed to the room air.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🛠️ **Dynamic Emission Modeling:** Models pollutant emissions that vary with activity or environmental parameters (e.g., temperature).
- 🌬️ **Ventilation Impact:** Includes air exchange rates to evaluate pollutant mitigation through ventilation.
- 🧪 **Chemical Interactions:** Accounts for temperature-dependent chemical properties using equations like Henry's Law and Arrhenius equation.
- 📊 **Visualizations:** Provides clear concentration profiles for pollutants over time and different scenarios.
